Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera project
===


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This repo includes the following: 

1. a **README.md** file (this file) that briefly explains the purpose of this project and the files to be included for submission
2. a **code book** (called CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
3. one **R script** called run_analysis.R that does the following:
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.   
4. an independent **tidy data** set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
