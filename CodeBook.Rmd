The goal of this exercise was to clean and reshape data originating from several files that were provided to us.

    1. Walking
    2. Walking upstairs
    3. Walking downstairs
    4. Sitting
    5. Standing
    6. Laying
    
Detailed steps to clean the data are included in the run_analysis.R script and will not be repeated here.
